TWO TIER APPLICATION DEPLOYMENT
This repository contains Terraform code to deploy a two-tier application architecture on a cloud provider. The two-tier architecture consists of a frontend tier and a backend tier. The frontend typically consists of a web server, while the backend tier consists of an application server or database server.
Architecture
The Terraform configuration in this repository sets up the following infrastructure:

Frontend Tier:

A Load Balancer distributing traffic to multiple web servers.
Instances of web servers (e.g., Nginx, Apache) running in an Auto Scaling Group.
Security Groups or Network ACLs to manage access.
Backend Tier:

A set of application servers or database servers.
Security Groups or Network ACLs to restrict access to only the frontend tier.
Optional: A managed database service (e.g., Amazon RDS, Azure Database, Google Cloud SQL).
Networking:

Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) or equivalent with subnets for the frontend and backend tiers.
Route Tables and Internet Gateway/NAT Gateway for outbound internet access.
Features
Automated provisioning of a two-tier architecture.
Configuration of networking components, including VPC, subnets, and security groups.
Optional Load Balancer for the frontend tier.
Auto-scaling for the frontend tier.
Secure communication between frontend and backend tiers.
Variable configuration for easy customization.
